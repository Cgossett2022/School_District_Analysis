# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
In this project, I am helping Maria analyze data across different high schools.

## Results
After performing the analysis, I discovered the following results:

1. The average scores for math and reading were slightly higher in charter schools than in public schools.

2. Neither charter nor public schools consistently improved math scores across higher grade levels, and this should be addressed.

3. The average reading score for 11th and 12th graders was above the average for charter and public schools, so 9th and 10th graders need to improve.
